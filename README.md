## **2015-Nepal Earthquake: Analysis**

This repository contains the `ipynb` file called `2015-Nepal.ipynb` and other supporting files including the Seismic and GPS data used for the analysis purposes.

### **Unpacking the Earthquake’s Effects**

* The 2015 Nepal earthquake was a seismic event that greatly shaped the Himalayan region, and I wanted to understand both its seismicity and the ground deformations it caused. My goal was to explore how tectonic stress was released in this geologically active region. To do so, I turned to seismic data from five global stations, using the resources provided by the IRIS network. Processing this data with the ObsPy Python package allowed me to dive into the earthquake's inner workings, focusing on P-wave arrival times and travel paths. This analysis gave me insights into how the earth's crust responded, showing clear differences between continental and oceanic crusts.
* However, seismic data alone wasn’t enough. To fully understand the earthquake's impact, I also gathered GPS data from the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory, focusing on two key stations. I used GMT to process the data and visualize the eastward, northward, and vertical ground displacements. The uplift I observed was particularly striking, providing geodetic evidence of the earthquake's direct impact on the region's tectonic structures.

### **What's Next for This Research**

* Going forward, I'm excited to integrate SAR data into my analysis. This will allow for even more detailed geomorphological insights, and I hope to draw stronger correlations between seismic wave amplitudes and GPS data. By understanding how the lithospheric setting influences earthquake impacts, I aim to shed new light on the tectonic activity in this critical region.
